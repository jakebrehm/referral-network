<!-- ## Main features

Here are just a few things that this project can do:
* Read message data from various sources, including your local iMessages database, a [Tansee](https://www.tansee.com) text file, or some randomly generated dummy text
* Perform text analysis on your messages so you can see things like the average number of texts received per day or the most number of messages that were sent in a row
* Analyze which emojis or reactions (if you're using iMessage) were most frequently used, among other thing
* Perform sentiment analysis on your messages to see the polarity of your conversations
* Calculate statistics about the attachments you exchanged (if you're using iMessage)
* Generate tailored visualizations such as word clouds or a radial heatmap that plots hour of the day against day of the week -->
